    <p class="about-us">
      Since career development is a lifelong process, Career Counseling can be appropriate for anyone, including 
      freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors, and even alumni. The earlier you get started making intentional
       decisions about your future, however, the better prepared you will be! We recommend that all freshmen come
        in and visit with a Career Counselor.
