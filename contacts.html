                There is no country in the world where the students are free of
                their career queries. During school time, it is never difficult
                for the students to select an elective subject, they select
                whatever interests them. However,the same strategy does not work
                while selecting a career.

                I’ve been recruiting for over 15 years and during those years
                I’ve worked with great companies and not so great companies. How
                do I know the difference? Well, one way is the feedback that I
                receive from my candidates when I ask them how their new job is
                working out. Are they being treated well? Are they respected?
                Are you receiving the support you need to be successful in your
                new position? Another way I can gauge how good a company is to
                work for is the number of times that I receive the same job
                order over and over, or there are always job openings when the
                client isn’t growing (these usually indicate a bad working
                environment).

              <p>
                The beginning of a new year is the time when many people set out
                to make major life changes, like getting fit or becoming more
                financially savvy. But if you always fail to keep your
                resolutions, clearly something is wrong. What if the change you
                really need can’t be found in a savings account or at the gym?
                What if the thing keeping you from a truly fulfilling life is
                your career?
